# Linked List Intersection Finder

This project contains a simple Java application that uses two linked lists to find their intersection point. The `Solution` class includes a function `getIntersectionNode` that identifies the intersection point.

## How to Use

1. In the `Main` class, example linked list nodes and an intersection point are created.
2. An instance of the `Solution` class is created, and the `getIntersectionNode` function is called.
3. If an intersection point is found, its value is printed to the console; otherwise, the message "No intersection found." is displayed.
